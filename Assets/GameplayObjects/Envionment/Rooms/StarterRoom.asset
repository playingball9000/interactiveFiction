  description: The train car stretched out in quiet solitude.  Rows of cushioned
    seats, most unoccupied, lined either side of the aisle, their fabric worn smooth
    from years of passengers coming and going. Overhead, a few stray luggage compartments
    hung ajar. The faint scent of aged upholstery and the metallic tang of the train
    itself mingled in the still air.
